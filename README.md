This is a Fighting Fantasy-style roll-the-dice combat game.
You play the knight, fighting the monster.
When you roll, the player with the highest score wins and inflicts damage the equivalent of the difference between the two dice rolls.
The winner is the player who depletes the other's hit points down to zero.

## Features

* Sounds!
* Two types of knight, chosen at random!
* Three types of monster, chosen at random!
* Animated 3D dice!
